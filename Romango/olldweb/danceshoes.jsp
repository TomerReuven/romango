  <h1><i>High Performance</i> Dance Shoes<br />
    <br />
  </h1>
	One of the main reasons I became a shoemaker was because, as a dancer, the performance and look of my dance shoe
	was an issue of great importance to me. I dreamed of one day making an ideal dance shoe. This shoe would need to have perfect fit, comfort,
	style and, above all else, <i>high performance</i>. <br /><br />
  <table width="95%" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="15">
	<tr>
      <td><div align="center"><img src="images/fit1.jpg" alt="dance shoes" width="400" height="266" border="1" /></div></td>
      <td valign="top"><p>High Performance begins with fit. Foot imprints are taken along with a great many measurements and observations. 
			Then test shoes are made to confirm and adjust for the final fit.
			<br /><br />
			Your shoes with be snug in the heel, hold your feet comfortably yet firmly, and not squeeze your toes.

			your feet, over time.</p>

			Here, the insole is stitched to the upper leather. This is the traditional and most durable form of construction.</p>

			<p>Kangaroo leather** is both unique and exceptionally durable. The liner is a vegetable tannned leather, which means there are no chromium containg 
			materials next to your feet.</p>
        <p>The thin outer sole gives the perfect balance of support and flexibility. Bottoms are colored to a dark sunset.
				Unlike suede bottom shoes, these may be worn out of doors, in a pinch.  </p>
