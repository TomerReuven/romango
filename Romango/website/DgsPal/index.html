<p><h1>DGS Pal</h1>
DGS Pal is a Java Application client for The Dragon Go Server.
</p>
<img src="example_board.png" alt="example board" />
<p>
The program was written to play Go on-line the way I want to play. I've been using the DGS web client for many years and it was deficient, 
from my perspective, in a several ways. 

<ol>
	<li>I only play one game at a time and I want that game to stay on my screen and not go away when I make a move.</li>
	<li>I want moves from my opponent to arrive on my board spontaneously with audible notification.</li>
	<li>I want to be able to play ahead to test out sequences in advance of commiting to a move.</li>
	<li>I want to be able to play ahead even when it is not my move.</li>
</ol> 

</p>


<p>
Due partially to limitations of the API provided by the creator of Dragon Go Server and partially that I have not implemented 
all the feature possible, DGS Pal cannot do everything. You must start games using the DGS web client. You must also score them using
the web client.
</p>

<h2>System Requirements</h2>

DGS Pal <b>requires</b> Java 7, update 13 or later
<br /><br />

Download the DGS Pal JAR file here:  Be sure to check back periodically for newer versions.

<br/>New Version (2/2/13) DGS Pal JAR file here: <a href="DgsPal-1.33.jar">DgsPal_1.33.jar</a>

<h2>Using DGS Pal</h2>

<ul>
<li>To avoid confusion initially, make sure you have one and only one game in progress on DGS. </li>
<li>Run the program by double clicking the JAR file. Resolve any run time issues. You may wish to put this in a .bat file for ease of access.</li>
<li>Click on the User Icon <img src="user_icon.png" alt="" /> and enter your DGS username and password. This is a one time operation. Close and restart the application.</li>
<li>You should now see your game. You may play ahead if it is your turn or not your turn. You may only commit a move if it is your turn.</li>
<li>If you have played ahead and you press commit, your first move will be played and the board will revert to actual positions.</li>
<li>The * button always returns you to actual positions.</li>
<li>You may rewind and forward through already played moves with the < and > buttons.</li>
<li>After you make your move, DGS Pal querys the DGS server at 1 minute intervals, then 2 minutes, then 4 minutes. Pressing the * button will requery DGS 
immediately, unless it is too soon and be in violation of DGS excessive usage policies.</li>
</ul>
