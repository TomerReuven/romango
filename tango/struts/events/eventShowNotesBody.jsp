<br>
If you are the owner of this event, you will have controls
to edit this entry and add a photo.<br><br>

You may upload a photo of any size, up to 1MB. They will
be shown 200 pixels wide, so they should be at least that wide.
If you click on the photo, it will show the full size picture.
<br><br>
You will also have a control to make the event invisible. This
is so that you can fool around making it look the way you want 
without it appearing on the list. By default, a new entry is visible.
