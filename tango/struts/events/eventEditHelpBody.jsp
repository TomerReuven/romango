<center><h3>Event Entry Notes</h3></center>
<br>
<b>Event Type</b> - The Event Type is determined by which section you clicked the "new" link on.
Make sure you have the correct section for your entry. Currently, we only support Eugene as a location.
The Event Type cannot be changed. So, make sure you have the type you want.
<br><br>
<b>Day</b> - If your event happens on a particular day of the week, select this here. This will allow viewers to 
list only the events for a particular day of the week.
<br><br>
<b>Start Date</b> - This should be the first day of your event. This date is only used to determine the order of events
within the section, so that the events coming up soonest will appear before those scheduled later. This date will not appear
anywhere on the listing, so be sure you put date information in your description. Regular or recurring events do not have
an entry for start date.
<br><br>
<b>Expire Date</b> - This is the day that event will no longer show in the events list. This will happen automatically. Enter
the date that is the day after your event. Your event is not deleted and can still be found, by you (the event owner), under 
Members -> My Events. This is very handy if you want to run your event again. In this case, you can just change the expire date
and whatever else you want, an the event will appear again. 
<br><br>
<b>Title</b> - Enter a title for you event. This will appear in bold font above your description.
<br><br>
<b>Short Title</b> - Enter a very short title for you event. This will appear in the calendar view. 
There is no need to indicate what type of event it is (milonga, class etc). This will be obvious from the icon.
<br><br>		
<b>Description</b> - Here is where you put all the information about your event. There are many formatting options
here. A few simple ones are<br> &lt;b&gt;this is bold&lt;/b&gt;= <b>this is bold</b><br>
&lt;br&gt; = new line<br>
You may also embed links to Flickr photos and even YouTube videos.
<br><br>
<b>Venue name and address</b> - If you enter a proper address here, you will automatically get a link to a Google map.
