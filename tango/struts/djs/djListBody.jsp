Derrick Del Pilar took his first tango steps in Buenos Aires. After spending half a year in the birthplace of tango, he returned to Tucson and began to dance locally and at festivals around the country.
<br/><br/>
Once he completed his B.A. in creative writing and Spanish literature at the University of Arizona, Derrick spent two years at Berkeley, earning an M.A. in Latin American studies (with a focus on Argentina) and dancing almost every night in of the largest and most diverse tango communities in the country. He is currently based in Eugene.
<br/><br/>
As a DJ, Derrick strives to pull the dancers out of their seats with thoughtfully arranged traditional tandas that showcase the best of the golden age orchestras. He has kept people dancing in Albuquerque, Berkeley, Chicago, L.A., Phoenix, Portland, and Tucson.
<br/><br/>
Derrick posts his English translations of golden age tango lyrics online at <a href="http://poesiadegotan.wordpress.com">http://poesiadegotan.wordpress.com</a>.

"The Music Makes the Milonga"<br><br>

Pam has been having a great time playing music for milongas in Oregon for the past five years.<br><br> 

She credits these picky, brilliant DJs for their inspiration:  Bill Alsup, Ban Boccia,  Robert Hauk, Steven Payne, Caroline Peattie, Megan Pingree, 
Christopher Nassaloupous and Jim Thurmond.
<br><br>
She enjoys the challenge of putting together a great night of  music  for dancers of all levels, with a good ration of vals and milongas.

Jeanine VanSise only began DJing two years ago, but has quickly gained a lot of experience in Oregon.  She currently DJs Milonga Entre Suenos at Studio B 
on Saturday nights in Eugene, and has guest DJ'd in Portland.  Last year she also DJ'd at The Ashland Grape Escape Tango Festival. 
<br><br>
She owes all of her mad DJ skills to Portland's Joe Leonardo, who taught her everything she knows, and to Mike McCarrel, who has spent a lot of time 
talking and sharing music. They both inspire her each time she gets to dance to their lovely sets!
